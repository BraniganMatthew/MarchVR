# Open VR Driver Example

This repository is an example on how to implement an Open VR driver that sends joystick and/or trackpad input to Open VR. This input will move the game character. This sample is simply hard coded to constantly send forward joystick and trackpad input to Open VR, causing the game character to constantly move foward just like if you were using a regular VR controller and holding the joystick/trackpad forward. You can take this example and replace the hardcoded move foward code with code that actually gets output from a device, such as a VR treadmill, VR shoes [like mine](https://github.com/finallyfunctional/vr-shoes-software), VR shoes like [CyberShoes](https://www.cybershoes.io/), or VR sensors similar to [Kat Loco](https://www.kat-vr.com/products/KAT-loco).

I created this sample and wrote lots of documentation in this [repository's wiki](https://github.com/finallyfunctional/openvr-driver-example/wiki) because I found the [existing OpenVR documentation](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/Driver-Documentation) and [driver sample](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/tree/master/samples/driver_sample) to be lacking. It was hard to create this sample initially, not knowing anything about OpenVR. I had to slowly piece together over many hours information from the documentation, sample, and other samples and Open VR implementations I found online to make this driver sample that simply moves the character forward. My hope is that this sample and the documentation I provide here will make it easier for complete beginners to start using Open VR.
